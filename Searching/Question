2.Linear Search

3.Interpolation Search

4.Given an array of n numbers, give an algorithm for checking whether there are any duplicate elements in the array or no?

5. Can we improve the complexity of Problem-4’s solution  //Sorting.

6.Is there any alternative way of solving Problem-4?   // Hashing

7.Given an array of n numbers. Give an algorithm for finding the element which appears the maximum number of times in the array?

8.Is there any other way of solving Problem-7? //Hashing

9.For Problem-7, can we improve the time complexity? Assume that the elements’ range is 1 to n.

10.Given an array of n numbers, give an algorithm for finding the first element in the array which is repeated. For example, in the array A = {3,2,1,2,2,3}, the first repeated
number is 3 (not 2). That means, we need to return the first element among the repeated elements.
