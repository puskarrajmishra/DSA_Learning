4.Given an array of n numbers, give an algorithm for checking whether there are any duplicate elements in the array or no?

5. Can we improve the complexity of Problem-4’s solution  //Sorting.

6.Is there any alternative way of solving Problem-4?   // Hashing

7.Given an array of n numbers. Give an algorithm for finding the element which appears the maximum number of times in the array?

8.Is there any other way of solving Problem-7? //Hashing

9.For Problem-7, can we improve the time complexity? Assume that the elements’ range is 1 to n.

10.Given an array of n numbers, give an algorithm for finding the first element in the array which is repeated. For example, in the array A = {3,2,1,2,2,3}, the first repeated
number is 3 (not 2). That means, we need to return the first element among the repeated elements.

11. Finding the Missing Number: We are given a list of n – 1 integers and these
integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is
missing in the list. Given an algorithm to find the missing integer. Example: I/P:
[1,2,4,6,3,7,8] O/P: 5     For Problem-10, can we use sorting technique?

12. For Problem-11, can we use hashing technique?

13. For Problem-11, can we improve the complexity? hint: Time Complexity: O(n), for scanning the complete array.

14.In Problem-11, if the sum of the numbers goes beyond the maximum allowed integer, then there can be integer overflow and we may not get the correct answer. Can we
solve this problem? 

15. Find the Number Occurring an Odd Number of Times: Given an array of positive integers, all numbers occur an even number of times except one number which occurs an odd number of times. Find the number in O(n) time & constant space. Example:
I/P = [1,2,3,2,3,1,3] O/P = 3.

16. Find the two repeating elements in a given array: Given an array with size, all elements of the array are in range 1 to n and also all elements occur only once except
two numbers which occur twice. Find those two repeating numbers. For example: if the array is 4,2,4,5,2,3,1 with size = 7 and n = 5. This input has n + 2 = 7 elements with all
elements occurring once except 2 and 4 which occur twice. So the output should be 4 2.

17. For Problem-16, can we improve the time complexity?  // Time Complexity: O(nlogn). Space Complexity: O(1).

18. For Problem- 26, can we improve the time complexity? // Time Complexity: O(n). Space Complexity: O(n).

19.  Consider Problem-16. Let us assume that the numbers are in the range 1 to n. Is there any other way of solving the problem?
